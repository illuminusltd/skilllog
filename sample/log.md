A short description.

17/09/2017  00:50:12  Started Doing logs of my work.

I will be referring to above line as "Header" in this description.
This is a sample log to help others come to a common log pattern.
This description may span many lines. Between the Header and Description leave
a blank line.
After you are done with description put a line break. On the new line put
relevant links like url to your commit or URL to a web site that you deployed.
After that put a horizontal rule on a new line by typing 3 consecutive
underscores ( ___ ).
